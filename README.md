## Introduction
This project seeks to enhance the understanding and evaluation of turfgrass by developing a model that utilizes visual rating data collected by the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP). By incorporating methodologies from item response theory and Gaussian Processes, and further refining the model with Hilbert Space Approximation, the project aims to accurately compare turfgrass cultivars across time and space. This approach addresses the challenges posed by the subjective nature of visual ratings and the variability in rating standards over time and across different locations. This model promises to elevate the scientific rigor of turfgrass research and management, supporting the NTEP's mission in evaluating turfgrass varieties across North America.
